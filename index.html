        Parallax (from Ancient Greek (parallaxis), meaning 'alternation') is a
        displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed
        along two different lines of sight, and is measured by the angle or
        semi-angle of inclination between those two lines.

        Sometimes you will find the things you weren`t even looking for. But
        when you find them, they`ll fit right in.

        Now, I realize that for many people, they could not even imagine wasting
        as much time on their phones as I had been (damn kids, these days!), and
        this article about not looking at your phone for two designated hours of
        the day is not a life hack, it may just be, well, life. But for us
        millennials, a phone is like second skin. Itâ€™s what we use to
        communicate, count our steps, wake us up in the morning, and put us to
        bed at night (thank you, Headspace app). While there are thousands of
        genius apps that can make you happier and healthier, we need space from
        our phones in order to be as happy and healthy as we can be. We should
        be using our phones only to add quality to our life rather than
        excessive scrolling, and we should not feel dependent on the little
        screens in our back pockets. A semi-digital detox totally changed my
        life and it might for you, too. (And I swear, I only checked Instagram
        once while writing this!)
